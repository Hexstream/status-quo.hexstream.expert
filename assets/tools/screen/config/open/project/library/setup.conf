# Libraries are opened according to a two-letter code.
#
# The scheme is:
#
#   - Use the first letter of the first two hyphen-separated words.
#   - If there is only one word (no hyphen), then use the first and last letters.
#
# In case of conflict, simply disambiguate with CTRL, yielding 4 slots:
#
#   - a b     (00)
#   - a C-b   (01)
#   - C-a b   (10)
#   - C-a C-b (11)
#
# (Represented in comments as "a b", "a B", "A b" and "A B" to preserve alignment.)
#
# We could theoretically add more bits if needed, by using Ctrl on earlier bindings.

# C-a o p l [?] (open library [?]...)
